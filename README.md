# Challenge4-IOT
Repository containing my solution of the fourth challenge for the IOT course (AY 2021/2022).

Objective of the challenge: create an application that provides a way of communication for two motes. Then a simulation performed with TOSSIM is launched and in total it excghanges a finite number of message based on the person code.
Also the startup of the second mote in the simulation is based on the person code.
